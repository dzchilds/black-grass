            <p>The BGRI team are now back at work, after spending a productive, if somewhat hot and sticky two days at this year’s Cereals event in Duxford, Cambridgeshire. For some of the team, this was our first Cereals event, and it proved a great opportunity to meet and speak with farmers, their agronomists and the wider industry about the burgeoning threat from black-grass. </p>

<p>It was very clear that the 2013/14 season has been a bad year for black-grass and that the start of the new BGRI project is very timely. The new team members have returned from Cereals with a clearer picture of the size of the task at hand and a great enthusiasm for the coming summer field season.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, the BGRI project was officially launched at the BBSRC science breakfast, and it was great to see such a large crowd interested to find out more about the project. We’ve spoken to a great number of people over the last two days, and would like to thank everyone who came over and expressed an interest. We are now looking forward to contacting growers across the country and establishing our network of sites for the coming field season. If you missed us at Cereals but would like to help, it’s not too late! Just E-mail our team at BGRI@Rothamsted.ac.uk and we’ll do our best to get in contact with you very soon.</p>

<p>Thanks again to everyone for the amazing interest that we’ve had over the last two days, and we look forward to seeing you again at Cereals 2015. </p>
