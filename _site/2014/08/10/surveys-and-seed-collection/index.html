            <p>After a busy field season mapping black-grass densities and collecting seeds, the BGRI team are now back in the office and the glasshouses preparing seeds for resistance testing and collating field management data. We would like to thank everyone that has helped to make this summer’s surveys and seed collection so successful!</p>

<p>Starting at the foot of the Chilterns in South Oxfordshire and winding our way up through 11 counties, we visited 71 farms and mapped a total of 138 fields of black-grass, to end up on the edge of the North Yorkshire Moors. We surveyed everything from a sea of black-grass with well over 100 plants per m², to a clean wheat field with only a few wisps of the troublesome weed.</p>

<p>The next step for this part of the project is to gather management information for each of the fields that were surveyed, to try and tease apart links between tillage, herbicide application, crop rotation and the prevalence of black-grass and evolving herbicide resistance.</p>

<p>Another major goal of the BGRI this summer has been to collect black-grass seed from as many farms as possible, allowing us to later look at the distribution of resistance across the country. As a result, come rain or shine this summer our teams have been scouring the countryside for wheat fields containing black-grass to collect seed from. We even enlisted the help of farmers from sites we couldn’t reach, to collect their own samples and to post them to us.</p>

<p>Since returning from the field, our attention turns to the un-enviable task of weighing the seed samples, and carefully cleaning them to remove immature and infertile seeds ready to begin resistance testing.</p>
