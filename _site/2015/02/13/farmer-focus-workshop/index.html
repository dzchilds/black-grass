            <p>On 12th February, the BGRI held its inaugural Farmer Focus Workshop. Many thanks to all of the farmers who attended the event in Warwickshire last week. This first meeting provided an opportunity for the BGRI team to introduce farmers to the science behind the project and to seek their views on research objectives and priorities.</p>

<p>The aim of these workshops is to facilitate communication and knowledge exchange between the BGRI and the farming community. We want to disseminate the findings of our research to farmers, but also to get their feedback on how useful this is and in which direction they think our research should be headed. To do this have established a group of 8 farmers who are interested in the science behind black-grass management.</p>

<p>After the BGRI gave a brief introduction to the project, each of the participants provided an overview of their current black-grass management activities and thoughts on herbicide resistance, black-grass and weed management in general. This was followed by a lively discussion on different approaches to, and reasons behind, techniques for black-grass management.</p>

<p>The day was rounded off with a farm walk around a nearby farm that is participating in the monitoring surveys, and a return into the warm for a cup of tea and a de-brief.</p>

<p>Through this initial meeting, we have developed relationships that will enable the BGRI to establish effective communication with those working at the ‘coal face’ of the burgeoning herbicide resistance problem. Participants in the workshop were enthusiastic about the project and are keen to continue attending. The plan now is to visit some of the different farms of those participating in the group as part of our next few Farmer Focus Workshops.</p>
