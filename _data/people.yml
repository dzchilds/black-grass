  position: Senior Research Scientist, Weed Ecology & Evolution
  institution: Rothamsted Research
  url:  http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/people/nevep
  about: With a particular interest in herbicide resistance, my research is focussed on understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that result in the establishment, persistence and spread of weed populations in agroecosystems. Working with weed populations, simulation models and model organisms, I investigate strategies for ‘evolution-free’ management of agricultural weeds.
