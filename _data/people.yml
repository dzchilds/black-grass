  about: I am a population biologist with interests at both the pure and applied ends of the spectrum. I follow an interdisciplinary approach, developing data-driven models to understand population dynamics and natural selection in laboratory and free-living populations. I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to shape selection on key ecological traits.

  about: My principle research interests are the responses and resilience of plant communities facing environmental stresses, and the longer term implications of these. Previous research has focussed on factors affecting the productivity of the forage perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) at sites across Europe. I will be investigating Blackgrass populations across the UK, and developing research which can be applied to managing this weed in the future.

  about: I have previously worked at the University of Sheffield as a research technician undertaking field experiments on the environmental interactions between seed size and seedling traits in different habitat types. I manage the glasshouse experiments that investigate herbicide resistance in black grass, whilst ensuring that information gathered from the project is fed back into the farming community. I am also interested is how science can interact with policy.

  about: My interests are focused on the biotransformation of herbicides and other biologically active chemicals in crops and weeds and how this can be used for biotechnological applications and in defining selective toxicity and resistance in plants.

  about: I am a population ecologist and evolutionary biologist. I have interests in plant population dynamics and modelling, with special interest in annual weeds. The BGRI project builds on the density-structured modelling approach that my group have recently developed.

  url:  http://jarrod.bio.ed.ac.uk
  about: I am an evolutionary biologist working mainly in the area of quantitative genetics; the study of inheritance, selection and evolution of complex traits. I use a combination of theory, statistical inference and experimentation in order to address questions regarding the form of natural selection and the nature of heritable variation.

  about: My research interests centre on sustainable agricultural practices and balancing food production with biodiversity conservation. Agricultural policy changes quickly, and the resulting changes to land-use patterns and land management practices can have wide-ranging ecological impacts. I believe strongly in the need to study, quantify and manage these impacts and the importance of knowledge exchange between science, policy makers and landowners.

  position: Senior Research Scientist, Weed Ecology & Evolution
  institution: Rothamsted Research

  about: With a particular interest in herbicide resistance, my research is focussed on understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that result in the establishment, persistence and spread of weed populations in agroecosystems. Working with weed populations, simulation models and model organisms, I investigate strategies for ‘evolution-free’ management of agricultural weeds.

  about: Previously, I have been involved in studies assessing the effects of metals on organisms at the University of Lille, France. I am delighted to join the Weed Ecology and Evolution team at Rothamsted Research. I will be working as a research technician helping investigate the molecular ecology of herbicide resistance in Black-grass.

  about: I have worked at Rothamsted Research for over 15 years. I'm particularly interested in translating scientific research results into meaningful, practical guidance for farmers and agronomists. I am also working on a CRD funded project, "Developing and promoting more sustainable grass-weed control strategies to combat herbicide resistance" and an HGCA funded project "Sustaining winter cropping rotations under threat from herbicide resistant black grass".
