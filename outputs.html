        <p>As the project develops summaries of project outputs -- such as scientific papers and outreach activities -- will be posted in this repository. We also hope to use this site as to archive data after completion of the project.</p>

<h3>Research Outputs</h3>
<h4>Meetings and conferences</h4>
<h4><small>Sept 2014</small></h4>
<p>The BGRI held its first stakeholder meeting at ZSL in London. It was attended by representatives from 14 organisations. The day included research updates from each part of the project and discussion groups in the afternoon. See our news article: First BGRI stakeholder meeting, on the <a
href=http://bgri.info/news/index.html> news<a/> page for more details.</p>

<p>Paul Neve attended a workshop: <a
                                     href= http://www.ncl.ac.uk/afrd/assets/documents/sm/AIC-landbridge%20workshop.pdf><i>Building on a solid foundation: Improving knowledge exchange in arable farming</i><a/>. This was an event hosted by AIC, AICC, HGCA and Landbridge. His blog entitled <i> Plugging the gaps in the knowledge exchange system</i> can be found <a
href= http://landbridgeblog.blogspot.co.uk/> here</a>.</p>

<h4><small>August 2014</small></h4>
<p>Rob Edwards: Plenary Speaker at the 13th <a
href=http://www.iupac2014.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/PICOGRAM-vol-86-_Congress-Program_4.pdf> <i>IUPAC International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry</i></a>, Crop Environment and Public Health Protection Technologies for a Changing World, San Francisco. ACS-AGRO/IUPAC sponsored session: Modes of Action and Resistance Management.</p>

<h4><small>June 2014<small></h4>
<p>Paul Neve and Dylan Childs attended a <a
href=http://andinallanos.weebly.com/><i>Special International Workshop on Weeds and Invasive Plants</i></a>.</p>

<p>Rob Edwards: Plenary speaker at an Association of Applied Biology Meeting on <a
href=http://www.epsoweb.org/event/breeding-plants-cope-future-climate-change-16-18-june-2014-university-leeds-uk><i>Breeding Plants to Cope with Future Climate Change</i></a> at the University of Leeds.</p>

<h4><small>May 2014<small></h4>
<p>Paul Neve organised a 2 day European workshop in Frankfurt, Germany on <a
href=http://www.ewrs.org/herbicide_resistance/><i>Herbicide resistance in Europe: Challenges, opportunities and threats</i></a>. Both Rob Edwards and Richard Hull presented at the workshop which examined current issues and challenges in resistance research management in Europe. The workshop included invited and contributed talks from researchers, practitioners and industry representatives.</p>

<p><a
href=http://www.ewrs.org/herbicide_resistance/doc/013_Edwards.pdf> A molecular basis for multiple herbicide resistance in black-grass</a> (Robert Edwards, UK).<p>

<p><a
href=http://www.ewrs.org/herbicide_resistance/doc/Hull.pdf> Is resistance to residual herbicides increasing in <i>Alopecurus myosuroides</i> (black-grass) populations?</a> (Richard Hull, UK).</p>

<h4><small>April 2014</small></h4>
<p><i>International Workshop: Non-Target Site Based Herbicide Resistance in Grass Weeds</i></p>
    
<p>A team of representatives from the Black-Grass Resistance Initiative (BGRI) met up with members of the Australian Herbicide Resistance Initiative (AHRI, University of Western Australia) and Bayer Crop Protection team (Germany) at the Malaysian Campus of the University of Reading in Johor.</p>
    
<p>The workshop had the aim of sharing knowledge of recent advances in resistance work and a review of recent research findings including the genetic architecture of non-target site resistance and resistance phenotypes. The participants reviewed the effectiveness of control strategies and identified key challenges and themes which could serve as points of common interest.</p>
