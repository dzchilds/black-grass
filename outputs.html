<p>Richard Hull talked on “Herbicide resistance: current status and future threats” at the <a                                                                            href=http://www.aicc.org.uk/aicc-national-conference-2015-13-15-january-2015-whittlebury-hall-towcester/><i> AICC (Association of Independent Crop Consultants) annual conference</i></a>, with approximately 150 agronomists in the audience.</p>
       
<h4><small>Sept 2014</small></h4>
<p>The BGRI held its first stakeholder meeting at ZSL in London. It was attended by representatives from 14 organisations. The day included research updates from each part of the project and discussion groups in the afternoon. See our news article,<a

<h4><small>May 2014</small></h4>
<p>Paul Neve organised a 2 day European workshop in Frankfurt, Germany on <a
href=http://www.ewrs.org/herbicide_resistance/><i>Herbicide resistance in Europe: Challenges, opportunities and threats</i></a>. Both Rob Edwards and Richard Hull presented at the workshop which examined current issues and challenges in resistance research management in Europe. The workshop included invited and contributed talks from researchers, practitioners and industry representatives.</p>
<p><a

<p><a
href=http://www.ewrs.org/herbicide_resistance/doc/Hull.pdf> Is resistance to residual herbicides increasing in <i>Alopecurus myosuroides</i> (black-grass) populations?</a> (Richard Hull, UK).</p>
<h4><small>April 2014</small></h4>
<p><i>International Workshop: Non-Target Site Based Herbicide Resistance in Grass Weeds</i></p>
<p>A team of representatives from the Black-Grass Resistance Initiative (BGRI) met up with members of the Australian Herbicide Resistance Initiative (AHRI, University of Western Australia) and Bayer Crop Protection team (Germany) at the Malaysian Campus of the University of Reading in Johor.</p>
<p>The workshop had the aim of sharing knowledge of recent advances in resistance work and a review of recent research findings including the genetic architecture of non-target site resistance and resistance phenotypes. The participants reviewed the effectiveness of control strategies and identified key challenges and themes which could serve as points of common interest.</p>
