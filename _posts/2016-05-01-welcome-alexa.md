title: Welcome Alexa, the newest member of the BGRI team
---

From 1st May, the BGRI team has an additional member. Alexa Varah will be working with Ken Norris at ZSL to look at the environmental and economic impacts of resistance management strategies. This will involve building scenarios for resistance management and creating computer models to predict the likely impacts on farmland biodiversity, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions.

My research looks at relationships between agricultural systems and biodiversity conservation. I am especially interested in finding ways of maximising food production whilst simultaneously conserving biodiversity and providing other environmental benefits.
