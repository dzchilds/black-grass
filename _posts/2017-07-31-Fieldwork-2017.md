title: BGRI in the field, summer 2017
---

Rothamsted colleagues Laura and Richard have led the BGRI field-team to complete another year’s Black-grass field surveying earlier this summer. This involved revisiting our network of farms and surveying all fields that had either winter wheat or winter barley in them, approximately 75 fields in total this year. 

We used the same technique as in previous years, walking the tramlines and recording the density of Black-grass in 20x20m² areas across the field, giving scores of low, medium, high and very high, as demonstrated in the picture. We also collected seed samples from fields that we knew had been collected in the original fieldwork in 2014. A total of 56 seed samples were collected, and these could be useful for resistance comparisons in the future. PhD student James Lambert from Sheffield University also used his drone to fly across as many of the fields as possible and the images captured will assist in validating the observation data. The field data has now been processed, and density maps have been sent to everyone that took part in this years survey. Another season of Black-grass field surveying is planned for 2018.
