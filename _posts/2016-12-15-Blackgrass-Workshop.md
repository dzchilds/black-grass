title: AHDB/BGRI Black-grass Management Workshop
---

On 13th - 14th December, the Black-grass Resistance Initiative held an AHDB funded black-grass management workshop at Rothamsted Research. The workshop brought together 80 stakeholders including farmers, commercial agronomists, industry representatives, research funders, policy-makers and public / private research organisations to consider future options and perspectives for black-grass management. 

The main objectives were to consider short, medium and long-term options for improving black-grass management towards the design of more integrated solutions that address the current herbicide resistance epidemic. Following one and a half days of presentations from various stakeholder groups, a final interactive session sought to distil ideas and perspectives into a series of future research priorities. Workshop sessions considered the current situation with black-grass and on-farm management responses, research wants and needs, and short-, medium- and long-term options for future black-grass management.
