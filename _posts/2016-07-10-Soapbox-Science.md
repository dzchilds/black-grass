title: Soapbox Science and Black-grass
---

On Saturday 9th July 2016, BGRI member Laura Crook from Rothamsted Research took part in a Soapbox Science event at Milton Keynes shopping centre. As part of the Soapbox science platform promoting the achievements of women in science, Laura took to her ‘soapbox’ for an hour, speaking to passing shoppers about Black-grass, herbicide resistance, and the importance of technicians in science. Complete with specimen Black-grass plants as props, Laura took the opportunity to raise awareness of the UK Black-grass problem and the BGRI project with the wider public, as well as encouraging people to consider a career in science. There was considerable interest from the public over the event, and Laura said she really enjoyed the whole experience. Many thanks to the other BGRI members and Laura’s family for their support, and thanks for the level of interest, and the many, many questions from everyone that stopped by.
