title: Second Farmer Focus Workshop
---

The BGRI held its second Farmer Focus Workshop on 19th November 2015, in Cambridgeshire, kindly hosted by Paul Drinkwater. The aim of this meeting was to update on the various aspects of the project whilst hearing the farmers own experiences of black-grass control and their views on the BGRI project.

Project updates were heard from Rothamsted and Sheffield University in the morning reporting on the two completed seasons of the density mapping and the dose response phenotyping experiments using the seed samples collected in the summer of 2014. There was also preliminary data presented of the trends in agricultural practices over the 70 farms from the management data collected by Sheffield.

The farmers were given the floor just before lunch to give their views on the project and the current battle with black-grass which proved to be a lengthy but lively discussion. Topics included grass leys, cover crops and rotations. There was also recognition from some that there are many organisations undertaking agricultural research but that a more collaborative approach between them all could help to tackle some of the big problems facing farmers.

The afternoon started with a presentation from Newcastle University comparing the current tests available for testing black-grass resistance and the potential for developing a device that can help detect Non-Target Site Resistance in the field. Unsurprisingly this idea was enthusiastically received by those around the table. The workshop finished with a discussion led by Paul Neve on possible new approaches to managing resistance such as the Harrington Seed destructor, RNAi, allelopathy, safeners and glyphosate resistance. 

All participants found the meeting very constructive and many thanks go to the farmers who attended the workshop. The continuing interest in the Farmer Focus groups ensures that these meetings will take place in the future.
