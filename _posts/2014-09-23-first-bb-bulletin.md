title: First issue of Black-grass Bulletin
---

Now that our summer survey season is over we thought we would take this opportunity to give you an update on progress. Here is the very first issue of the [Black-grass Bulletin](/assets/news-letters/BlackGrassBulletin_Issue1.pdf), our project newsletter. 

The Black-grass Bulletin will keep you up to date with whatâ€™s happening across all areas of our research over the 4 years of the project. This first issue focusses on the mapping work that we carried out this summer, the seed sampling, plans for the herbicide resistance testing, and an update on media coverage of the project.
