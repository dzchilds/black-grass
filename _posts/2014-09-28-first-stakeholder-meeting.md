title: First BGRI stakeholder meeting
---

On Thursday 25th September the BGRI held its first stakeholder meeting. Representatives from 14 organisations made the journey to London to attend our meeting at ZSL – not only on the promise of a lunchtime pass into the zoo, but more importantly, to get updates from the BGRI team and to contribute to the project.

We kicked off proceedings with a round-up from each of the PIs. First up, Rob Edwards gave us a run down on the genetics work that has been undertaken so far. Of the 17,000 genes in black-grass, 1600 have been found to change in response to herbicide resistance and 24 have been identified as possible markers of resistance. One particular gene, associated with a protein with enzyme activity, is consistently upregulated and we’re using this to develop a pocket-based diagnostic kit to detect resistance in the field.

Rob Freckleton talked through the black-grass density mapping work that has been carried out over the summer and revealed that of all the 20x20m grid squares surveyed, only 12% had no black-grass in them. Very high densities of the weed were recorded in 15% of grid squares, while 1% had been sprayed off to kill the black-grass before it set seed. He said that knowing the management histories for the sampled fields will help us begin to understand how such high density populations develop.

Seed collection over the summer has supplied seeds for the herbicide resistance trials over the coming months. Paul Neve gave details on plans for the resistance testing, with 190 populations of black-grass to be tested for resistance to both ALS and ACCase herbicides under glasshouse conditions. Plans were also outlined to extract DNA from 36 individuals in each black-grass population and test plants directly for the individual ALS and ACCase resistance mutations present. These experiments should be completed by spring 2015, and the results will inform us of the current extent and types of resistance occurring across the range of farms surveyed this summer.
Future work looking at the eco-evolutionary modelling of black-grass populations was also discussed, alongside work to explore the economic and environmental consequences of resistance management strategies using farm-scale cost-benefit analyses.

The afternoon session was run in small break-out groups which discussed 3 topics:

1. **Adding value to the BGRI** project and the concept of ‘BGRI-plus’ as a means to facilitate future funding and collaborative opportunities between the BGRI team, stakeholders and the wider research community in the UK and Europe.
2. **Maximising impact of the results of the BGRI project** and making sure that they’re converted into workable solutions for black-grass management.
3. **Future linked projects** including new opportunities for collaboration and possible funding streams for researching novel solutions for management of black-grass.

*Overall, we had an incredibly productive day of ideas-sharing and were delighted with the enthusiasm and contributions from all of the stakeholders.*
