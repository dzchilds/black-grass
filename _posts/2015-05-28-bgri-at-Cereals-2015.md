title: BGRI @ Cereals 2015
---
Come and see the BGRI team on the BBSRC-Rothamsted stand at Cereals next week. BGRI researchers will be present throughout the event to provide updates on the latest research (including the national resistance audit), talk about future plans and listen to the experience of those managing black-grass at the coal face. On the second day (Thursday 11th June), Paul Neve will give a brief update on the BGRI project at a BBSRC-hosted breakfast briefing.
