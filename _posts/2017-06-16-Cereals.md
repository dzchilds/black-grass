Cereals 2017 was held at Boothby Graffoe on 14th and 15th June 2017, with the BBSRC-AHDB Black-grass Resistance Initiative showcasing results from the project on the Rothamsted Research stand.  

A black-grass breakfast meeting was held on the 14th, with BGRI members Rob Edwards, Paul Neve and David Comont, highlighting outcomes from various aspects of the project to members of our farmer focus and stakeholder groups. Topics discussed ranged from in-field diagnostics, to variability in glyphosate control of black-grass populations and what to do with ‘big data’. Other members of the BGRI team including Laura Crook and Richard Hull manned demonstration plots on the Rothamsted stand, showing how black-grass control can be affected by either sowing a different cereal crop, or by changing drilling date. We also highlighted some key outcomes from the blackgrass workshop held in December 2016, focusing on new technologies.
