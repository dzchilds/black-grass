Hot off the press! Here's the second installment of our Black-grass Bulletin [Black-grass Bulletin](/assets/news-letters/BlackGrassBulletin_Issue2.pdf), our project newsletter.


The Black-grass Bulletin will keep you up to date with whatâ€™s happening across all areas of our research over the 4 years of the project. This second issue focusses on identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning multi-herbicide resistance and the potential for developing in-field diagnostic tools.
