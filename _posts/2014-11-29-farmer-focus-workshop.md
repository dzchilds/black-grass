title: Farmer Focus Workshops
---

After a very successful stakeholder meeting in September the BBSRC-HGCA black-grass resistance initiative (BGRI) have decided to run a series of Farmer Focus workshops to maximise the impact of our project.

The aim is to facilitate communication and knowledge exchange between the BGRI and the farming community. We want to disseminate the findings of our research to farmers, but also to get their feedback on how useful this is and in which direction they think our research should be headed. To do this we are establishing a small focus group (8/9 participants nationally), comprised of invited farmers who are interested in the science behind black-grass management.

This first meeting, to be held early 2015, will provide an opportunity for the BGRI team to introduce farmers to the science behind the project and to seek their views on research objectives and priorities. There will also be an opportunity for each of the participants to provide an overview of their current black-grass management activities and thoughts on herbicide resistance, black-grass and weed management in general. The day will be rounded off with a farm walk around a nearby farm that is participating in the monitoring surveys.

Through this initial meeting, we hope to develop relationships that will enable the BGRI to establish effective communication with those working at the ‘coal face’ of the burgeoning herbicide resistance problem.
