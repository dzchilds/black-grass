title: Welcome to the newest member of the BGRI
---

The BGRI has a new team member from the start of this month. Shaun will be developing mathematical models to understand how field- and landscape-scale processes influence the evolution of herbicide resistance.

##### Shaun Coutts  

I am a quantitative ecologist who uses statistical, analytical and simulation models to look at pressing environmental issues such as invasive species spread and management and wildlife harvest. I also use these approaches to address fundamental questions in ecology such as what drives population dynamics and what allows species to co-exist? This work encompasses a wide range of topics such as population dynamics, community ecology, dispersal ecology, and social-economic systems. I am currently modelling the evolution of herbicide resistance in black grass to test how fast and under what circumstances we might expect herbicide resistance to evolve.
