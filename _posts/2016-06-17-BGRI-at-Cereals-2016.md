title: BGRI @ Cereals 2016
---

Once again the BGRI team were out in force at this year’s Cereals event, held over the 15th and 16th June at Duxford. The BGRI plot on the BBSRC/Rothamsted Research stand featured wheat at four different levels of Black-grass infestation, demonstrating the different scales of problem encountered by our field team. 

As usual, members of the BGRI were present over both days to answer your black-grass related questions, discuss the project, and share the results that we’ve discovered so far. Our annual Black-grass Breakfast meeting took place on the morning of the 15th providing an update on current progress, and this year included one of the first public demonstrations of our prototype resistance diagnostic kit, under development by BGRI researchers at Newcastle University. Many thanks to everyone who dropped by our stand over the two days, and remember to watch our website for further updates as the project develops.
