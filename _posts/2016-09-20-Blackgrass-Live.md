title: Soapbox Science and Black-grass
---

In July, Bayer held its first ‘Black-grass Live’ event which consisted of a Question-Time style format with a chairperson and a panel of six experts to lead the conversation and answer questions submitted by the audience. BGRI member Richard Hull from Rothamsted Research was invited to be part of the panel and Laura Crook, also from Rothamsted, attended the event. As well as an audience of farmers and journalists, the whole show was streamed live on the internet for the public to watch. 

The questions were divided into four areas to consider the key topics for controlling black-grass; resistance, cultivations, cropping and chemistry. Discussions included the potential resistance to glyphosate in the future, rotations and cover crops, the strive for new chemistry and a debate over the best cultivation strategy. The whole event was a great success and interesting to hear the views of farmers working at the frontline, tackling the huge problem that black-grass is causing on farm.
