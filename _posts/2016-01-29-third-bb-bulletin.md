title: Third issue of the Black-grass Bulletin
---

The third installment of our Black-grass Bulletin project newsletter is here! [Blackgrass Bulletin Issue 3] (/assets/news-letters/BlackGrassBulletin_Issue3.pdf)


The Black-grass Bulletin will keep you up to date with whatâ€™s happening across all areas of our research over the 4 years of the project. This third issue covers the results of the completed herbicide resistance testing carried out over 2014-2015, and how we'll be building on this data over 2016.
